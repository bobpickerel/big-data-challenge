# big-data-challenge
Challenge goal was to take a dataset and transform it using pySpark then to upload it to a postGres database hosted in RDS AWS.

Files up loaded include 2 jupyter notebooks from Google Colab and sql scripts to create the tables in postGres.

A personal RDS database was used to house the postGres tables.
